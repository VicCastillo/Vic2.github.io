<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>
$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

LightSourceAndShadow
=========================

NetLogo Model of Light source(s), a movable screen, and a light-sensitive film used for an introductory course on modeling.

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VicCastillo/LightSourceAndShadow/master/LightSourceAndShadow-Screenshot.png)

## HOW IT WORKS

The light sources are treated as points and emit particles. The light particles that are not blocked by the screen help to expose a film-like surface, making it brighter. Rays can be drawn to show the exposure boundaries for each light source. A histogram reports the number particles that make it to the film locations as local intensity.

## HOW TO USE IT

Set the screen position (screen-x), the number of lights, and the ray-motion; press `setup` and then press `go`. For an exercise in the modeling class, we look at different `ray-motion` (straight, curve-left, and wiggle). The exercise is to gather evidence to support different models.

The `make-shadow-lines` function shows where the light is blocked by the screen and cannot expose the film.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

As the light rays get the film on the right side, the discreet points become brighter. The histogram shows the brightness for each of these discreet points. Think of these as pixels on a screen. Sometimes these discreet points are on the shadow boundary. In this case, the intensity might not match one's expectation. This is like a numeric round-off error.

## THINGS TO TRY

Try running with different number of light sources and the screen at different locations. Can you predict how the film will be exposed?

Try different `ray-motions`… How does the film expose? Does this match your expectations?

## NETLOGO FEATURES

A list is used for the light y-positions. The list is modified for an even number of lights.

When the sources create the shadow boundaries, two shapeless turtles are created. The shape has no features. The two are then differentiated by their `who` number. We look for the max `who` for the upper boundary and then the min `who` for the lower.
